# Hello, GitHub

My first self-initiated repository on GitHub. This is a simple "Hello, GitHub!" program in C that was created to walk through the process of committing code to GitHub and of navigating personal projects. 

Thank you, FreeCodeCamp, for the tutorial!

I'm working on transitioning from the CS50 sandbox to Visual Studio Code on my local machine. Hoping to make regular git commits a turn-key process.
